# Different impact of fruit and vegetable vouchers on dietary intake among low-income American adults between cities: a comparison of San Francisco and Los Angeles programs

Background: While fruit and vegetable vouchers have been observed to improve dietary quality metrics among low-income populations in randomized trials, how well such findings apply to diverse populations in different environments remains unclear.

Methods: We distributed fruit and vegetable vouchers ($20/month for six months) among low-income adults in San Francisco and Los Angeles that could be used at local grocery and corner stores. We performed 24-hour dietary recalls before and during voucher receipt to assess improvement in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake as well as Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and performed a transportability analysis to understand what factors may explain variations in voucher effectiveness between the cities. 

Results: Among N =  671 participants (516 in San Francisco, 155 in Los Angeles), we observed an increase in fruit and vegetable intake by +0.22 cup-equivalents (95% CI: 0.14, 0.31; P<0.001) among both groups, but with a much greater impact in Los Angeles (+0.10 in San Francisco, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.19, versus +0.64 in Los Angeles, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.88). We observed parallel results for the improvement in HEI scores. While voucher redemption rate and numerous demographic and environmental factors did not explain the difference in voucher effectiveness between the cities, income was a key explanatory variable in the transportability analysis--suggesting that the lower income of the Los Angeles population could statistically explain the higher effectiveness of the vouchers in the San Francisco than in the Los Angeles participant population.

Conclusions: The effectiveness of fruit and vegetable vouchers differed between San Francisco and Los Angeles, with the differences potentially explainable by income differences between the two enrolled sets of participants.
